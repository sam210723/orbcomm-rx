# üì° orbcomm-rx - STX Demodulator and Decoder
**orbcomm-rx** is a demodulator and decoder for the Orbcomm VHF [Subscriber Transmitter (STX)](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Orbcomm) downlink. Each satellite in the Orbcomm constellation transmits two STX carriers between 137-138 MHz. These downlinks contain satellite position data, orbital elements, uplink/downlink channel info, and encrypted user messages.

## Demodulator
The STX downlinks are modulated using Symmetrical Differential Phase Shift Keying (SDPSK) at a data rate of 4.8 kbps.
